<legend>Gravatar?</legend>

If you go to <b> DASHBOARD > Account </b>, you will see your default profile picture (or Gravatar) in blue. Click the 'change' button below. While at Gravatar.com, if you wish, you can create a gravatar profile.  Given that you use the same email as you used here on the site, after you upload a profile picture to the Gravatar profile, it will be shown here as well (your blog).  Ofcourse, we can always create a row in the database for a profile picture.  But that's bandwidth and database usage when we could just piggyback off Gravatar like the new world is doing anyhow.
